## 1\. Introduction <a name = "1"></a>

### 1.1\. Purpose <a name = "1.1"></a>
This document contains functional and non-functional requirements for the mobile application "tistic.co" for iOS 12 and higher. This document is intended for a team that will implement and verify the correctness of the application.

### 1.2\. Business requirements<a name = "1.2"></a>

#### 1.2.1\. Initial data <a name = "1.2.1"></a>
Modern IT technologies are making their way into all areas of human life. Maintaining electronic medical records is especially popular, since it saves patients from excessive bureaucracy with paper-based documents. It is also convenient for doctors, who at any time can get information about the medical history of patient. But not all electronic media have information about the health of the patient's teeth and people must use paper-based documents.

#### 1.2.2\. Business opportunities <a name = "1.2.2"></a>
Many people want an application that will allow to store health data electronically, with minimal technical literacy. Such application will allow them to spend less time searching for necessary information about their health. This will also allow doctors to spend less time for collecting information about the patient. The designed user interface should allow the application to be used by people with minimal technical knowledge.
